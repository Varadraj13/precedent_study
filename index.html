        <h2 class="section-title">3-Layer Analysis</h2>

        <h3>1. Ontological Analysis</h3>
        <p>The Beirut Port Explosion investigation by Forensic Architecture is a multi-layered project composed of diverse components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Social media videos, CCTV footage, satellite imagery, seismic and acoustic data, photographs, and official documents.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytical Tools:</strong> Open-source intelligence (OSINT), 3D modeling, photogrammetry, audio-visual synchronization, GIS mapping, and metadata analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Interactive 3D reconstructions, synchronized video timelines, architectural diagrams, mapped viewpoints, public-facing website, and legal documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These layers allow users to trace the spatial unfolding and exact timing of the explosion using verifiable public evidence.</p>

        <h3>2. Historical and Contextual Analysis</h3>
        <p>The explosion on August 4, 2020, exposed deep corruption in Lebanon. Over 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded due to years of government inaction. The event caused over 200 deaths and displaced hundreds of thousands.</p>
        <p>Forensic Architecture stepped in as independent investigators, filling the void left by the Lebanese government’s resistance to accountability. Their project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenged false state narratives.</li>
          <li>Constructed a forensic timeline using open data.</li>
          <li>Supported legal efforts by victims' families and international advocates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The work reframes the explosion as a political crime born of systemic failure and negligence, not simply an industrial accident.</p>

        <h3>3. Visual and Aesthetic Representation</h3>
        <p>Forensic Architecture’s aesthetic is rooted in clarity, minimalism, and architectural precision. Their representational techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Geolocated media:</strong> Videos are placed in 3D space to verify location, timing, and perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline synchronization:</strong> Audio and visual data are aligned using the speed of sound to triangulate key events.</li>
          <li><strong>Architectural sections:</strong> Used to show the layout of the port and internal structure of warehouses.</li>
          <li><strong>Color-coded visuals:</strong> Distinguish stages of the explosion – fire, flash, shockwave, and red cloud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project speaks through a formal visual language grounded in architecture, scientific analysis, and legal advocacy. The viewer becomes a participant, interpreting spatial evidence and contributing to a collective pursuit of justice. The aesthetic choices deliberately avoid sensationalism, focusing instead on legibility and credibility.</p>

      <section id="network">
        <h2 class="section-title">Actor Network & Diagram of Responsibility</h2>
        <p>
          The Beirut Port Explosion was not a singular event, it was the result of a complex entanglement of actors, infrastructures, decisions, and failures. Through the lens of Forensic Architecture, this actor network is visualized as a layered diagram that links:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Spatial Actors:</strong> The silos, Warehouse 12, port authorities, surveillance cameras, and spatial vantage points.</li>
          <li><strong>Institutional Actors:</strong> Lebanese customs, the judiciary, government agencies, and international suppliers.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Agents:</strong> Photographic metadata, sensor logs, satellite footage, and architectural blueprints.</li>
          <li><strong>Civil Actors:</strong> Victims’ families, investigative journalists, and activist networks demanding accountability.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-zoom-container" style="cursor:pointer;display:block;max-width:100%;margin:2rem 0;">
          <img src="Actor network diagram.png" alt="Actor network diagram for Beirut Port Explosion" style="max-width:100%;display:block;" id="actor-network-img" />
        </div>
        <p>
          These actors are not neutral, they shape, suppress, or reveal the narrative. FA’s actor-network diagram performs a spatial forensics of complicity, showing how visibility, power, and material evidence intersect.

      <section id="methodology">
        <h2 class="section-title">Methodology & Computational Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Forensic Architecture’s methodology fuses spatial computation with critical inquiry. In the Beirut case, the team reconstructed the blast using:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Photogrammetry:</strong> Crowdsourced images stitched to create 3D spatial models of the silos and the explosion site.</li>
          <li><strong>Video Synchronization:</strong> Multiple phone and CCTV footages aligned by soundwaves and shockwave patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Blast Wave Simulations:</strong> Spatial software modeling to estimate the direction and intensity of the pressure wave.</li>
          <li><strong>Material Layering:</strong> Satellite imagery and urban fabric were overlaid to visualize zones of destruction.</li>
          <li><strong>Metadata Forensics:</strong> Timestamps, GPS data, and resolution quality were all used to verify the authenticity and location of visual sources.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This computational approach wasn’t just aesthetic — it functioned as legal and evidentiary material for a counter-investigation.
        </p>

      <section id="rhetoric">
        <h2 class="section-title">Critical Framing & Rhetoric of the Precedent</h2>
        <p>
          Forensic Architecture’s rhetorical strategy is rooted in counter-visuality. Their Beirut project positions itself not as objective documentation, but as an active challenge to the state’s narrative void.
        </p>
        <img src="methodology 01.png" alt="Methodology diagram for Beirut Port Explosion reconstruction" style="max-width:100%;margin:2rem 0;display:block;" />
        <p>
          The precedent is “critical” not only in its technical depth, but in its refusal to remain silent. It argues — visually and rhetorically — that architecture is not just built form but also:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>witness</strong> to violence</li>
          <li>A <strong>tool</strong> for truth-seeking</li>
          <li>A <strong>medium</strong> of protest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The work draws attention to absence — of accountability, of government transparency, of justice. It exposes that forensic truth must often be reconstructed from the fragments of visual culture, not institutional trust.
        </p>

      </section>
      <div class='section-divider'></div>

      <section id="context">
        <h2 class="section-title">Forensic Architecture’s Wider Practice</h2>
        <p>
          The Beirut investigation fits within FA’s broader mandate: to document state violence and institutional negligence using spatial and computational tools. Other investigations, from drone strikes in Gaza to illegal pushbacks in the Mediterranean — show a consistent pattern:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Utilization of open-source intelligence (OSINT) as a research base</li>
          <li>Architecture as both spatial analysis and evidentiary material</li>
          <li>Radical transparency, all data sources are publicly accessible</li>
          <li>Collaborations with journalists, artists, human rights NGOs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this wider landscape, Beirut becomes not just a local tragedy but a global demonstration of how computational tools can intervene when institutional ones fail. FA’s work repositions the architect as investigator, coder, activist, and witness.
        </p>

      <section id="critique">
        <h2 class="section-title">Appraisal + Critical Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          This precedent is deeply impactful in how it merges rigorous computational modeling with political urgency. It doesn’t aestheticize catastrophe, it renders it legible, accountable, and shareable.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the project also raises questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How accessible is this work to non-experts or communities on the ground?</li>
          <li>Is spatial evidence enough to cause political change without institutional support?</li>
          <li>What happens when data is correct, but ignored?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a precedent in computational design, FA’s work is essential. It teaches us that modeling is not just for design, it is a tool for dissent. And that architecture, when reprogrammed, can illuminate structural injustice.
