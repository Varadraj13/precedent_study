        <h2>3-Layer Analysis</h2>

        <h3>1. Ontological Analysis</h3>
        <p>The Beirut Port Explosion investigation by Forensic Architecture is a multi-layered project composed of diverse components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Social media videos, CCTV footage, satellite imagery, seismic and acoustic data, photographs, and official documents.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytical Tools:</strong> Open-source intelligence (OSINT), 3D modeling, photogrammetry, audio-visual synchronization, GIS mapping, and metadata analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Outputs:</strong> Interactive 3D reconstructions, synchronized video timelines, architectural diagrams, mapped viewpoints, public-facing website, and legal documentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These layers allow users to trace the spatial unfolding and exact timing of the explosion using verifiable public evidence.</p>

        <h3>2. Historical and Contextual Analysis</h3>
        <p>The explosion on August 4, 2020, exposed deep corruption in Lebanon. Over 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded due to years of government inaction. The event caused over 200 deaths and displaced hundreds of thousands.</p>
        <p>Forensic Architecture stepped in as independent investigators, filling the void left by the Lebanese government‚Äôs resistance to accountability. Their project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Challenged false state narratives.</li>
          <li>Constructed a forensic timeline using open data.</li>
          <li>Supported legal efforts by victims' families and international advocates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The work reframes the explosion as a political crime born of systemic failure and negligence, not simply an industrial accident.</p>

        <h3>3. Visual and Aesthetic Representation</h3>
        <p>Forensic Architecture‚Äôs aesthetic is rooted in clarity, minimalism, and architectural precision. Their representational techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Geolocated media:</strong> Videos are placed in 3D space to verify location, timing, and perspective.</li>
          <li><strong>Timeline synchronization:</strong> Audio and visual data are aligned using the speed of sound to triangulate key events.</li>
          <li><strong>Architectural sections:</strong> Used to show the layout of the port and internal structure of warehouses.</li>
          <li><strong>Color-coded visuals:</strong> Distinguish stages of the explosion ‚Äì fire, flash, shockwave, and red cloud.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project speaks through a formal visual language grounded in architecture, scientific analysis, and legal advocacy. The viewer becomes a participant, interpreting spatial evidence and contributing to a collective pursuit of justice. The aesthetic choices deliberately avoid sensationalism, focusing instead on legibility and credibility.</p>
